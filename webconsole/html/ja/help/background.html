<A NAME="BACKGROUND"></A><h2>Configuration Manager Help</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Sun Java&#8482; Desktop System Configuration Manager Help pages.</p>

<p>Using the Configuration Manager, administrators can assign 
profiles to individual users or organisational units stored in a central 
configuration storage such as an existing corporate LDAP server. The 
configuration settings defined in these profiles are then applied on behalf of 
the users to the applications running on the Sun Java Desktop System such as the 
Gnome desktop, Mozilla, StarOffice and Gnome applications like Evolution.</p>
