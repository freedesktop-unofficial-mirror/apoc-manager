<p>Welcome to the Sun Java[TM] Desktop System Configuration Manager Help pages. 
To get help for a specific part of the Java Desktop System Configuration Manager,
 click on one of the links on the left.</p>
<p>The help starts by describing the Configuration Manager general product
 background and concepts - <a
class="help-link" href="#concepts">Background & Concepts</a>. Some general
 layout and behavioral aspects of the Configuration Manager can be found in
 <a
class="help-link" href="#ui">Layout and Behavior</a>.
</p>
<p>After the general pages more specific help is available for the <a
class="help-link" href="#masthead"><b>Masthead</b></a>, the <a
class="help-link" href="#navigation"><b>Navigation pane</b></a> and the <a
class="help-link" href="#content"><b>Content
pane</b></a>.  There are also pages that cover the <a class="help-link"
href="#login">Login</a> and the <a href="#reporting">Reporting</a> feature.

<div class="help-header-1">Background & Concepts</div></p>
<p>The Configuration Manager enables the centralized management of configuration
 settings. It is possible to view, define, and enforce configuration settings on
 different levels of an organization's hierarchy. Configuration settings that are
 semantically coherent are referred to as "configuration policies" in the rest of
 this document.</p>
<P>The Configuration Manager deals with three different hierarchical structures,
 also known as trees. To understand the Configuration Manager user interface, it
 is important to distinguish between the two trees:</P>
<p><div class="help-header-2"><a name="dataStructures">Data Structures</a></div></p>
<P>One tree is formed by the configuration policies, and is thus called the
 configuration policy tree (see blue parts of figure 1 - "Trees"). A hierarchical
 organization of configuration settings is already familiar to users from many
 programs that have a more sophisticated configuration, like Mozilla. A typical
 configuration policy can be referred to with "/Mozilla/Navigator", a configuration
 setting with "/Mozilla/Navigator/HomeUrl".</P>
<P>Configuration policy trees are incorporated into the second type of tree, the
 organization tree (see gray parts of figure 1 - "Trees"). The organization tree
 represents relationships between organizational units. The result is an
 "organization tree containing configuration policy trees". The organization tree
 is represented using an LDAP server.</P>
<p>The third type of tree is the domain tree. The domain tree represents
 relationships between hardware units.  Configuration policy trees are incorporated
 into the domain tree, resulting in a domain tree containing configuration policy
 trees. The domain tree is represented using an LDAP server.</p>
<p>The concepts for working with the organization tree and the domain tree are the 
same. The main difference between the two is that the organization tree maintains
 users and the domain tree maintains hosts. Having users and hosts in two separate 
trees enables the Configuration Manager to provide user-based and host-based configuration.
 Due to the similarities between the two trees, this section focuses on the organization
 tree and only mentions the domain tree when differences exist between the organization
 tree and the domain tree.</p>
<P>LDAP servers are commonly used in large enterprises to map
organizational data in a hierarchical way. Each location within the
organization tree in LDAP is called an entity.</p>

<p><div class="help-header-2"><a name="SecDataManagement">Security and Data
Management</a></div></p>
<p>This "tree of trees" facilitates hierarchical security and data management. 
This is accomplished by initially inserting the whole configuration policy tree 
once at the root of the organization tree. Entity-specific changes to the 
configuration settings of that initial configuration policy tree are stored at 
the corresponding entity. For simplicity, figure 1 only illustrates the configuration
 policy trees associated with the organizational entities that are called 
"marketing" and "jclarke".</P>
<p><div class="help-header-2"><a name="GenConfigSettings">Generation of Configuration
Settings</a></div></p>
<P>The configuration settings for an entity are gotten by merging. All configuration
 settings, which are associated with an entity in the organization or domain tree,
 are called layers. The merging begins with the root layer and follows the tree
 until the desired entity is reached. A change in a configuration setting, in a
 layer associated with an entity, is inherited by the layers that are associated
 with entities farther down in the tree hierarchy (see <A class="help-link" HREF="#fig_merging">figure 2 - "Layer
Merging"</a>).
 The inherited values can be overwritten if a particular layer defines its own
settings.</p>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><IMG SRC="/apoc/html/images/help_merge.gif" NAME="LayerMerging" ALT="Layer Merging" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=550 HEIGHT=520 BORDER=1>
<P><A NAME="fig_merging"></A>&nbsp;<I><FONT SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#000000">Figure
2 &ndash; Layer Merging</FONT></FONT></I></P>
<p>This inheritance holds true for configuration settings, and also holds true for
 security characteristics: specifying the security attribute "protected" for one 
configuration setting in the layer attached to "o=marketing" will make this configuration
 setting in all subsequent layers of the tree read-only (see <A class="help-link" HREF="#fig_protection">figure 3 -
"Protection"</a>).</P>

<p><div class="help-header-2"><a name="BCAssociating">Associating a Configuration Policy Tree with an Organization or Domain
Tree</a></div></p> 
<p>Configuration policy trees are bound to the entities
 of an organization tree in two different ways:</P>
<UL>
	<li>Stored at an entity as
	 self-contained configuration policy trees</li>
	 <li>Linked to an entity from a policy
	 group</li>
</UL>
<p><p><div class="help-header-2"><a name="BCPolicyGroups">Policy
Groups</a></div></p>
<P>Policy groups are containers for configuration
policies, they each have a (unique) name associated with them. They
are also containers for a configuration policy tree, because
configuration policies store their configuration settings in a
configuration policy tree (see <A class="help-link" HREF="#fig_trees">figure 1 &ndash;
&quot;Trees&quot;</A>). Policy groups are stored in a policy repository
 and can be used by all types of entities by creating link(s)
to policy group(s). This allows more flexibility, independent of the
backend used. Another advantage of the policy groups is that they can
be imported and exported which eases maintenance.</P>
<P>The administrator can create collections of configuration policies for
 separate semantic ranges, for instance an "Experts" and a "Novice" policy group
 stored in the policy repository. The configuration policies can then be used 
throughout the organization tree.</P>

<a name="ui"> </a>
<div class="help-header-1">Layout and Behaviour</div>
<p>The layout for the Configuration Manager consists of three areas: a Masthead,
 a Navigation pane, and a Content pane. The masthead is located on the top section
 of the page. The area on the lower left side contains the Navigation pane.
 The area on the lower right is the Content pane. This type of layout is also
 referred to as Left-Right pane set. Separate browser windows are opened for
 displaying additional dialogs and displaying help content.</p>
<div align="right"><a href="#top" class="help-return-link">

    Back to top</a></div>


<a name="login"> </a>
<div class="help-header-1">Login</div>
<p>To use the Configuration Manager, you must login to the Sun Web Console. The
 Sun Web Console is the location for management applications, all of which have
 a consistent user interface. An advantage of the Console is that an administrator
 can log in once and use any application inside the console. For this purpose the 
Sun Web Console provides a standard login page.</p>
<p>On the standard login page, the server that you are going to log into is displayed
 above the text fields for the user name and password.</p>
<p>After you have logged into the Web Console successfully, you arrive at the Web
 Console application launch page. From there, you can select the "Configuration Manager"
 application, which launches the Configuration Manager.</p>
<div align="right"><a href="#top" class="help-return-link">

<a name="masthead"> </a>
<div class="help-header-1">Masthead</div>
<p>The Masthead has the full product name (Sun Java[TM] Desktop System Configuration Manager) across it. 
The Masthead also provides a number of general links:</p>
<ul><li>The <b>Console</b> link returns you to the Sun Web Console application launch page.</li>
    <li>The <b>version</b> link opens a version window.</li>
    <li>The <b>Log Out</b> link logs you out of the Sun Web Console, and thus the
 Configuration Manager, returning you to the Login page.</li>
    <li>The <b>Help</b> link opens these help pages.</li>
</ul>

<a name="navigation"> </a>
<div class="help-header-1">Navigation pane</div>
<p>The Navigation pane allows you to browse the organization tree, which contains
 organizations, users and roles, and to browse the domain tree, which contains
 domains and hosts. It also allows you to manage policy groups in the corresponding
 users and hosts policy repositories.</p>
<p>There are two top-level tabs in the Navigation pane: <b>Users</B> and
<b>Hosts</B>.</p>
<a name="entities"> </a>
<div class="help-header-2">Users Tab</div>
<p>Two sub-tabs, <b>Organization Tree</B> and <b>Policy Repository</B>, are provided. Browse
 the organization tree using the <b>Organization Tree</B> tab.</p>
<a name="parpath"></a><div class="help-header-3">Parentage Path</div>
<p>At the top of the <b>Organization Tree</B> tab is the parentage path, which is a
 control that visualizes the path to the current entity. Every path particle
 is a link that represents an entity, except for the last link, which is displayed
 as normal text and denotes the current entity. To navigate using the parentage
 path, click on a link. This will:
<ul><li>Refresh the Navigation pane so that the parentage path points to the 
clicked entity, and so that the navigation table contains the sub-entities of
 that entity.</li>
    <li>Refresh the Content pane with the configuration policy data associated 
with that entity. </li>
</ul>
The navigation and Content pane are synchronized throughout the application to 
provide a homogeneous view of the data.</p>
<a name="navtable"></a><div class="help-header-3">Navigation Table</div>
<p>The navigation table is located below the parentage path, and lists the 
sub-entities of the current entity. The "Name" column contains the names of all 
sub-entities of the current entity. The "Type" column displays the type of the 
entity. The "Action" column contains a <b>View</B> link for every row.</p>
<p>To navigate to an entity click on a listed name, this will:
<ul><li>Make the selected sub-entity the current entity.</li>
    <li>Refresh the Navigation pane so that the parentage path points to the new
 current entity, and so that the navigation table contains the sub-entities of that entity.</li>
    <li>Refresh the Content pane with the configuration policy associated with that entity.</li>
</ul></p>
An entity can be of type "Organization", "User" or "Role".</p>
<p>To view a listed entity's details click on the <b>View</B> link. This will:
<ul><li>Change the background color of the selected row to blue. </li>
    <li>Refresh the Content pane with the data associated with the selected entity.</li>
</ul>
A row with blue background marks the entity whose data is currently visible in 
the Content pane.</p>
<p>The action bar of the navigation table contains the <b>Filter</B> drop-down menu 
and and the <b>Advanced Filter</b> icon. When the table contains more than ten entries, 
the <b>Page/Scroll Through All Data</b> icon appears, which allows you to change the view of 
the table entries.</p> 
<p>The<b>Filter</b> drop-down menu allows you to choose which type of entity to display in the 
navigation table. It contains the following items:
<ul><li>"All Items" displays all types of entities in the navigation table.</li>
    <li>"Organizations" displays only entities of type "Organization" in the 
navigation table.</li>
    <li>"Users" displays only entities of type "User" in the navigation
table.</li>
    <li>"Roles" displays only entities of type "Role" in the navigation
table.</li>    
</ul></p>

<a name="adfilter"></a><div class="help-header-3">Advanced Filter</div>
<p>Click the <b>Advanced Filter</B> icon in the navigation table to open the Advanced Filter dialog.</P>
<p>In the <b>Type</b> section, mark the type of entity that you want to filter. For a 
more specific filter, enter the name that you want to perform the filter on in 
the <b>Name</b> text field. Then click the <b>Filter</B> button at the bottom of the dialog 
to run the filter.</p>

<a name="search"></a><div class="help-header-3">Search</div>
<p>To open the Search window click the <b>Search</b> button above the navigation table. 
The Search window contains a masthead, a parameter area on the left, and a result 
area on the right. The Search window can be used to recursively search through 
the organization tree for certain entity types and entity names. If the
<b>Search</b> 
button in the Navigation pane of the main window is clicked while the Search window 
is open in the background, the Search window becomes the topmost window. The 
current entity of the Search window, which is displayed by the parentage path 
in the parameter area of the Search window, is refreshed. All other parameters 
and the content of the result area are unchanged.</p>
<p>The parameter area displays the parentage path at the top, and it visualizes the
path to the current entity.  The use of the parameter area is described in the
 <a class="help-link" href="#parpath">Parentage Path</a> section.</p>
<p>To search for a particular entity type, select that type from the drop-down 
list underneath the parentage path. The six selections are "Search All", 
"Search Organizations", "Search Users", "Search Roles", "Search Domains", and 
"Search Hosts".</p>
<p>To further narrow the search, you can use the text box that is located next to the drop-down 
list. This allows you to search for entity names that match the search string 
that you entered in this field. The starting point to search from in the tree 
can be specified selecting one of the <b>Starting Point</b> radio buttons. The choices 
are to search from the current location or to search from the top of the tree. 
The default value is to search from the current location. The locations are r
epresented by their names. Clicking on any path particle in the parentage path 
will change the current location for the search to the selected entity but will 
not change the scope of the navigator's view.</p>
<p>Select the number of results to be displayed from the
"Results displayed per page" drop-down list.</p>
<p>All search fields in the search pane accept the asterisk "*" as a wildcard at
 any position in a search string. The asterisk represents an arbitrary number of
 arbitrary characters. If multiple search criteria are specified, all search 
criteria must be fulfilled for an entity to be added to the result table. 
The search is not case-sensitive.</p>
<p>To perform the search, click on the <b>Search</b> button, which refreshes the result
 area with a table containing the search results.</p>
<p>To reset the page values click on the <b>Reset</b> button, which refreshes the 
parameter area with the default values. All text boxes are emptied, and the 
first value is selected in all drop-down lists and radio button groups.</p>
<p>The result area contains a blank page when the Search window is created. 
After performing a search, a result table is displayed. The result table 
contains three columns: "Name", "Type" and "Path".</p>
<p>To view a result, click on the corresponding name under the "Name" column. This will: 
    <ul><li>Make the main window the topmost window.</li>
        <li>Refresh the Navigation pane of the main window so that the entity 
represented by the "Name" link is an entry in the navigation table with a blue 
background. </li>
        <li>Refresh the content area of the main window with the configuration
policy associated with that entity.</li>
    </UL>
</p>
<p>The "Type" column displays the type of the entity. An entity can be either of
type "Organization", "User"or "Role".</p>
<p>The "Path" column contains the path to the entity. The path is relative to
the starting point of the search.</p>
<p>If the type searched for is "User", the parameter area displays different 
text boxes to accommodate the characteristics of a user: "User ID", "First Name", 
and "Last Name". In the result area, an additional "User ID" column appears to 
the right to the "Name" column, containing the user IDs. If the "User ID" text 
box in the parameter area contains at least one character, the primary sort 
column is the "User ID" column. If not, the primary sort column is the "Name" column.</p>
<a name="hoststab"> </a>
<div class="help-header-2">Hosts Tab</div>
<p>The <b>Hosts</B> tab contains two sub-tabs that are called <b>Domain Tree</B> and
<b>Policy Repository</B>, respectively.</p>
<a name="domtree"></a><div class="help-header-3">Domain Tree Tab</div>
<p>The Domain Tree displays the configuration settings for the hardware that the 
user is working on.</P>
<p>Navigation through the Domain Tree works in the same way as navigation through
 the Organization Tree, see the <a href="#entities">Users Tab</A> section for more details.
<a name="actionbar"></a><div class="help-header-3">Action Bar</div>
<p>The <b>Filter</B> drop down menu in the navigation table contains four items:
<ul><li>"All Items" - displays all types of entities</li>
    <li>"Domains" - displays entities of type Domain</li>
    <li>"Hosts" - displays entities of type Host</li>
</ul>
</p>
<a name="adfilterhosts"></a><div class="help-header-3">Advanced Filter</div>
<p>The Advanced Filter for the Domain Tree works in the same way as the Advanced
Filter for the Organization Tree (see the previous <a href="#adfilter">Advanced
Filter</a> section).  The Advanced Filter for the Domain tree provides "Domain" and "Host" entity types to
filter from.</p>
<a name="searchhosts"></a><div class="help-header-3">Search</div>
<p>When you click on the <b>Search</b> button in the <b>Domain Tree</b> tab, the 
Domain Search appears. The Domain Search operates in the same way as the search 
in the Organization Tree (see <a href="#">above</a>), but the Staring Point field 
is set to "Hardware".</p>

<div class="help-header-2">Policy Repositories</div>
<p>A <b>Policy Repository</b> tab exists under both the <b>Users</B> tab and under 
the <b>Hosts</B> tab.</P>
<p>A policy repository is a container for either user policy groups or host 
policy groups. The policy groups are organized in an ordered list. The sequence
 is defined by priorities.</p>

<a name="psptable"></a><div class="help-header-3">Policy Group Table</div>
<P>The policy group table is located at the top of the page and lists the policy
 groups. The table contains three columns: a selection column, "Name", and "Priority". </P>
<P>The selection column is used to mark the rows to which the actions listed in
 the <b>Policy Group Action</b> drop-down menu are applied.</P>
<P>To navigate to a Policy Group, click on its name. This will:</P>
<UL>
   	<li>Change the background color of the row clicked on to blue.</li>
   	<li>Refresh the Content pane with the data that is associated with the 
selected policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "Priority" column contains the priority of the policy group. The priority 
is used to define the merge order of the policy groups if an administrator has
 associated more than one policy group to an entity.</p>
<P>A row with blue background marks the policy group whose data is currently viewed
 in the Content pane, the viewed policy group.</P>

<a name="pspactions"></a><div class="help-header-3">Policy Group Action Bar</div>

<p><a name="psppriorities"></a><div class="help-header-3">Policy Group
Priorities</div></p>
<p>The concept of policy group priorities allows the administrator to define the order in which the layers are merged. The policy group priorities are used during merging if an entity has more than one policy group assigned. In this case, the hierarchy of entities is not sufficient to determine the sequence in which the policy groups are merged. This is solved by assigning priorities to policy groups.</p>
<p>To open the policy group priorities dialog select <b>Edit Priorities</b> from the
 <b>Policy Group Actions</b> drop down menu. To increase or decrease the priority of a policy group:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select the policy group from the list</li>
    <li>Click on the <b>Move Up</b> or <b>Move Down</b> button to increase/decrease the priority </li>

<div class="help-header-1">Content Pane</div>
<p>The Content pane displays the data associated with the selected entity or
 policy group in the Navigation pane. The data is grouped in tabs. The
 selections made in the Navigation pane determine the number and type of
 tabs displayed in the Content pane. The <b>Policies</b> tab is the default active 
tab. The currently active tab stays active if selections are changed in the
 Navigation pane, as long as the selection made offers that tab. If not, the
 <b>Policies</b> tab becomes the active tab. The internal state of a tab (parentage path,
 sort order) is recalled when the tab becomes active again.</p>
<a name="policies"> </a>
<div class="help-header-2">Policies Tab</div>
<p>Use the <b>Policies</B> tab to navigate the configuration policy tree displaying subgroups, configuration settings or both.</p>
<p>Every Policies page has two buttons: 
<ul><li><b>Report</b>: see the <a href="#reporting">Reporting</a> section for details.</li>
    <li><b>Clear Settings</b>: this button recursively deletes all configuration data below the subgroup currently displayed for the viewed entity. </li>
</ul>
</P>
<p>Every root entry in the configuration policy tree denotes an application, for instance, "StarOffice 7". The tree below the application organizes the configuration policies that belong to that application. Configuration policies can be located anywhere in the configuration policy tree. If a configuration policy is not a leaf of the configuration policy tree, the policy table as well as the configuration policy need to be displayed for one current location in the configuration policy tree. </p>
<a name="caparpath"> </a>
<div class="help-header-3">Parentage Path</div>
<p>The parentage path is displayed at the top of the page underneath the tabs. 
It visualizes the current location in the configuration policy tree.  It
functions in the same way as the parentage path in the Navigation pane (see
previous<a
class="help-link" href="#parpath">Parentage Path</a> section).</p>
<a name="subgroupstable"> </a>
<div class="help-header-3">Subgroups Table</div>
<P>The Subgroups table is located below the parentage path. The table lists the subgroups of the current location in the configuration policy tree. It contains two columns: "Name" and "Comment".</P>
<P>The "Name" column contains the names of all subgroups of the current location in the configuration policy tree. The name is displayed as a link. To navigate through the configuration policy tree click on a name link. This will:</P>
<UL>
    	<li>Refresh the Content pane so that the parentage path points to the new location in the configuration policy
tree.</li>
   	<li>Refresh the Content pane so that either a policy table or a policy is
displayed.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This kind of navigation is referred to as "drill down"
type navigation.</P>
<P>The Comment column contains a short description of the subgroup.</P>
<A NAME="capolicies"></A>
<div class="help-header-3">Policy</div>
<P>If valid configuration policy data is available for the combination of the current entity and the current configuration policy, the "Policies" tab in the Content pane displays that data.</p>
<p>The data is presented in tables. The tables have four columns. A selection column that contains selection icons, a "Status" column, a "Name" column and a "Value" column. The action bar on the table has a drop down actions menu </p>
<p>To select an element check the checkbox in front it. An action from the drop down actions menu in the action bar can now be performed on the selected element. The following table describes all actions:</p>
