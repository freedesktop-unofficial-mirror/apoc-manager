<A NAME="gbgdh"></A><h3>Advanced Options</h3>
<p>The Advanced Options page allows you to specify advanced options for the current
profile. There are two main options available on this page:</p>
<ul><li><p>Applicable from: allows you to move the profile to a different storage
location in the organization or domain tree. By moving the storage location, you are
also changing the set of elements that the profile can be assigned or applied to.
This is because a profile can only be assigned to the element it is stored at, or
assigned to the elements that are in the subtree below the element at which it is
stored.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade><p><IMG ALT="Caution" src="graphics/caution.gif">  <b>Caution &#8211; </b>You can not change the &#8220;Application from&#8221; parameter in
a way that the resulting layout would violate the rule mentioned above. For example,
this would happen if you move a profile down the tree hierarchy, and an existing assignment
connecting the profile to an element below the profile's storage location would, after
the movement of the profile, connect the profile to the same element. But now, the
element is above the storage location of the profile. If the you try this, the action
is cancelled, and a warning message is displayed.</p><hr size="1" noshade></li>
<li><p>Merge Order: specifies the order in which all profiles stored at the
same element are merged. </p>
<p>Because more than one profile can be assigned
to a single element and more than one profile can define the same setting, the order
in which the profiles are merged for a single element must be defined. This resolves
the conflicts of one setting being defined in two or more profiles assigned to the
same element.</p>
<p>The storage location is used first to determine the merge
order. The profile stored at an element that is located closer to the root of the
tree is merged first. As a consequence, the profile that is stored deeper in the tree
hierarchy is merged secondly. The settings of a profile merged later overwrite the
settings of a profile merged earlier.</p>
</li>
</ul>
