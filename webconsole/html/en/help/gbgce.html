<A NAME="gbgce"></A><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Desktop Manager is a tool that offers centralized management of configuration
settings, called <i>profiles</i>, for desktop applications. The Desktop Manager allows
you to view and assign profiles to the various elements of an organization's or domain's
hierarchy.  Profiles are applied when a user starts a desktop session or an application
that is managed by the Desktop Manager. All the profiles relevant for the user or
the host running the application are retrieved, and their settings are integrated
with the local defaults of the application and the user's custom settings. Profiles
can be used to provide a set of centrally managed defaults to the application or to
enforce mandatory settings.</p>
<p>Terms you should know:</p>
<ul><li><p><A NAME="indexterm-1"></A><i>Configuration Repository</i>: The organization and domain
tree container, together with the profiles stored in it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><A NAME="indexterm-2"></A><i>Domain</i>: An element in the domain tree. Represents
a realm in a computer network. May contain domains and hosts.</p>

<li><p><A NAME="indexterm-3"></A><i>Element</i>: A logical object to which configuration
data can be assigned. Users, roles/groups, and organizations are examples of entities
known to the Desktop Manager</p>
