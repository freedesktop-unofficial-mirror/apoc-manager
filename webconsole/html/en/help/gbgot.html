<A NAME="gbgot"></A><h4>Viewing and Editing a Profile's Configuration Settings</h4>
<h5>Steps</h5><ol><li><p><b>To view a profile's configuration setting, navigate to the setting from
the list of categories on the right side of the page.</b></p><p>The configuration
settings are organized hierarchically into categories that directly correspond to
the configuration options of desktop applications, such as StarOffice&#153;,
Mozilla&#153;, Evolution or Gnome. </p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Click the desired configuration setting.</b></p><p>The selected profile's
settings appear, which displays the available settings for that profile. If necessary,
additional context information is provided, such as the effects of individual settings
or the allowed value range. </p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade><p><b>Note &#8211; </b>If you select a category rather than a configuration setting, a table
appears that lists that categories settings or sub-categories.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade></p></li>
<li><p><b>For each configuration setting, you can either specify a concrete value,
or you can leave the setting undefined.</b></p><p>If you leave the setting undefined,
the application will not be affected by this profile setting, and instead takes advantage
of its own factory built-in default value. In general, the Profile Editor lists and
applications default value through additional help text or, if possible, through a
marker directly in the setting's options list.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade><p><b>Note &#8211; </b>It is important to understand that several profiles might affect the same
user. For example, you can create a profile with settings for a specific organization.
These settings are automatically available for all users that are part of this organization.
Similarly, you can define additional profiles with configuration settings for sub-organizations.
These may overwrite settings of the parent organization, for example, different proxy
settings for sub-organizations would be defined, but leave other settings unchanged.
The effective settings for a specific user would then be the result of a merge process
including all profiles assigned to the organization, sub-organizations and probably
the user. </p>
<hr size="1" noshade></p><p><hr size="1" noshade><p><b>Tip &#8211; </b>In some cases you might want to control this merge process and want to
enforce a configuration setting, meaning that it should not be possible for other
profiles to overwrite your setting and to define a different value.  The Profile Editor
allows to specify for each setting the desired merging behavior. The default is that
other "profiles may overwrite" a setting. Deselecting this option will enforce the
setting and other profiles can no longer overwrite your value.</p>
