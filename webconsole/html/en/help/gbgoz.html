<A NAME="gbgoz"></A><h3>Viewing Effective Settings</h3>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-39"></A>Effective Settings is a read-only view of the effective configuration
settings for a given element, such as an organization, domain or host.</p>
<p>The effective settings of a specific user are the result of a merge process,
including the configuration settings stored at the involved organization level(s),
role(s), and the user. You can display the merged configuration settings of a selected
element in a separate Effective Settings window. This allows for easy verification
and also error debugging. An Effective Settings report can also be printed and stored
for archival purposes.</p>
<h5>Steps</h5><ol><li><p><b>Click the Effective Settings button in the Assigned Profiles table.</b></p><p>When first opened, the effective settings for the selected element in the navigation
tree are displayed.</p>
<p>The Effective Settings window consists of the following
two sections:</p>
<ul><li><p>In the Modify Effective Settings Parameters section, the Create the
Effective Settings Using area lets you choose which tree to take into account. The
Select an element from the Domain Tree option lets you choose which entities to generate
a Effective Settings report for. Use the Browse button to select an element in the
organization or domain tree.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Effective Settings section displays the following:</p>
<ul><li><p>The location of the selected element in the hierarchy and the hostname.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The time and date when the current effective settings report was generated.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the Profiles Involved section, the list of profiles involved in
generating the effective settings report for the current element. They are listed
in merge order form most relevant to least relevant. Each profile is a link that opens
the Profile Editor window for the profile.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Settings Summary area displays the configuration settings for
the current effective settings report, grouped into categories. The Settings Summary
contains Name, Value, and Status fields.</p>
<p>The Status column contains entries
of the type &#8220;Defined In &#60;pofileName>&#8221;, where &#60;profileName> is a
link that opens the Profile Editor for that profile on the Configuration Settings
tab, and navigates to the particular setting within this profile.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><b>You can modify a generated effective settings report by changing any relevant
effective settings parameters, and then clicking the Generate Effective Settings button
at the top of the Effective Settings window. </b></p><p>A new report is then displayed
in the Effective Settings window.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>To print an effective settings report, click the Print button at the top
or bottom of the Effective Settings Window.</b></p></li>
</ol>
