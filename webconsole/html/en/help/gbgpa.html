<A NAME="gbgpa"></A><h4>Searching for an Element</h4>
<A NAME="indexterm-24"></A><A NAME="indexterm-25"></A><p>The Search function allows you to recursively search for an element in the domain
or organization hierarchy. It searches for not only the direct children of an element,
but also all descendents. To perform a search of only the direct children of an element,
use the Find function.</p>
<p>A search opens the Search window, which also allows you to perform a more advanced
search.</p>
<h5>Steps</h5><ol><li><p><b>Type the name or partial name of the element that you wish to search for
into the search field.</b></p><p><hr size="1" noshade><p><b>Note &#8211; </b>The search is not case-sensitive and not strict, for example, the search
string "bc" will match "ABC" and "bcd". An asterisk (*) denotes an arbitrary sequence
of characters within a search string. You can use more than one asterisk at any location
in the string. An empty field is equivalent to a field with the search string &#8220;*&#8221;.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade></p></li>
<li><p><b>Click the Search button.</b></p><p>The Search window opens. Any string
that you typed into the search field of the Navigation area is moved from that search
field to the search field of the Search window, and a search for that string is started
automatically. Any results are then displayed in a results table, which shows the
name, type and path of any found elements.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade><p><b>Note &#8211; </b>The maximum number of results is capped at 100.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade></p><p>If no results were found, or if you left the search field in the Navigation
area blank, you can type in the name of an element in the search field of the Search
window. </p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade><p><b>Tip &#8211; </b>Use the type modifier list, located next to the search field, to search
for a specific element type, such as &#8220;Search domains&#8221;.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade></p></li>
<li><p><b>If necessary, add advanced options to the search by clicking the Show
Advanced Options button.</b></p><p>The advanced options consist of the following:</p>
<ul><li><p>Restrict to: you can determine the element at which the search algorithm
should start to traverse through the tree.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Results displayed per page: allows you to determine the number of
results displayed on every page of the results table.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><b>Click the Search button again to view results for a new or modified search.</b></p><p><hr size="1" noshade><p><b>Note &#8211; </b>Clicking the Reset button changes all search parameters to the default
and clears the Search field.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade></p></li>
